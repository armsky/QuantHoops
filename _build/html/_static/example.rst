What is QuantHoops
==================
There is a revolution happening in basketball. The convergence of technology, data and forward thinking basketball minds has produced a new wave of statistical analysis. With the help of new technology, data that was once tracked in secret, behind NBA walls, is now available for the masses.

At the collegiate level, there are thousands of hard data points, but most programs don't know what to do with all the information. There aren't many programs maximizing the data currently at their fingertips, and we are going to change that.

For a college basketball coach, it is easy to become overwhelmed with the amount of data available (if you are even looking at it). You most likely don't have the budget to hire a full-time Director of Basketball Analytics. With this site, you won't have to. We can do the work for you.

Our hope is to highlight key trends in the data for both self scouting and opponent analysis. What do the numbers mean? How do the advanced stats translate on film? What am I seeing on paper to validate/refute my assumptions about our team or our opponents? What are the key takeaways?

If you are a college coach in D1, D2 or D3, let QuantHoops become your outsourced, high-powered Basketball Analytics departments.

What we do
----------
We provide deep analysis by triangulating available data points like tempo-free stats, synergy analytics, SportVU data and video breakdown; time of possession, efficiency by play type, and possession ratings. This stuff is all done at the NBA level, but hardly seen in the college ranks... The list is limitless.

Our goal is to highlight key trends in data for both self-scouting and opponent analysis and roll it into an easily digestible format, including:

 * In-season game by game analysis
 * In-season opponent scouting reports
 * 5 man unit analysis and position combinations
 * Player profiles and individual analysis
 * End of season self-scouting reports (team and players)
 * Synergy statistical analysis
 * SportVU data analysis

Tempo-Free Philosophy
---------------------
Points per possessions and points allowed per possession are two of the most important stats in basketball. How often do you score, how often do you get stops? Every coach must know where his/her team stands across each of these categories, right?

Wrong.

This seems like a mainstream concept, yet why are tempo-free stats still so under-utilized? How many coaches know their team’s average points per possession? And what about other tempo-free stats? How many know their turnovers rate (TOs per possession)? How many coaches look at the numbers, yet don’t know what to do with them?

In Division 1, these stats are readily available. You can trend, slice and dice this data for days. As an example, most D1 teams license Synergy scouting software, primarily for film exchange and video scouts. Most users don’t utilize the volume of data Synergy houses by team, player, conference, play-type, etc.

If you wanted to, you could literally run tempo-free reports all day. But more importantly, what should you do with all this data? Triangulating these data points – tempo-free stats, synergy analytics and video breakdown, can be a powerful tool for any program. Unfortunately, very few programs have the time and resources to effectivelly use this information.

In a perfect world, most schools would hire a Director of Basketball Analytics to track and analyze things like five-man unit data (points per possession, pts allowed per possession for each unit), position combinations, time of possession, efficiency by play type, possession ratings, track shot location, player efficiency by play type, individual defensive (forced shot missed, allowed field goal). The list is almost endless.

At the D2 and D3 levels, tempo-free stats were up to this point nonexistent. Not anymore my friends. Want to know the most efficient team in the NESCAC conference? Who’s the worst defensive team in all of D2? Look no further folks, this site is your answer.

If nothing else, it can’t hurt to look at this data. With the help of a trained eye (QuantHoops), we’ll help you find the value hidden in the numbers.
